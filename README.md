# Academic Project Page Template
This is an academic paper project page template.


Example project pages built using this template are:
- https://www.vision.huji.ac.il/deepsim/
- https://www.vision.huji.ac.il/3d_ads/
- https://www.vision.huji.ac.il/ssrl_ad/
- https://www.vision.huji.ac.il/conffusion/


## Start using the template
To start using the template click on `Use this Template`.

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style. 
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.  

## Components
- Teaser video
- Images Carousel
- Youtube embedding
- Video Carousel
- PDF Poster
- Bibtex citation

## Tips:
- The `index.html` file contains comments instructing you what to replace, you should follow these comments.
- The `meta` tags in the `index.html` file are used to provide metadata about your paper 
(e.g. helping search engine index the website, showing a preview image when sharing the website, etc.)
- The resolution of images and videos can usually be around 1920-2048, there rarely a need for better resolution that take longer to load. 
- All the images and videos you use should be compressed to allow for fast loading of the website (and thus better indexing by search engines). For images, you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com), for videos you can need to find the tradeoff between size and quality.
- When using large video files (larger than 10MB), it's better to use youtube for hosting the video as serving the video from the website can take time.
- Using a tracker can help you analyze the traffic and see where users came from. [statcounter](https://statcounter.com) is a free, easy to use tracker that takes under 5 minutes to set up. 
- This project page can also be made into a github pages website.
- Replace the favicon to one of your choosing (the default one is of the Hebrew University). 
- Suggestions, improvements and comments are welcome, simply open an issue or contact me. You can find my contact information at [https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/eliahu-horwitz/](https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/eliahu-horwitz/)

# GenAssist
Blind or low vision (BLV) creators use images to communicate with sighted audience members. 
However, creating or retrieving images remains challenging as it is difficult for BLV creators to use existing graphical authoring tools or assess image search results. 
Thus, creators describe their desired images to sighted people who create or retrieve the images or limit the types of images they create. 
While text-to-image generation models could let creators generate multiple high-fidelity images based on a text description (i.e. prompt), it is difficult to assess the content and quality of the generated image. 
We propose GenAssist, a system to make text-to-image generation accessible. 
Using our interface, creators can verify whether generated image candidates followed their prompt, access additional details added to the image but not specified in the prompt, and skim a summary of similarities and differences between image candidates. 
To power the interface, GenAssist uses a large language model to generate visual questions, vision-language models to extract answers, and a large language model to summarize the results. 
Our study with 12 BLV creators demonstrated that GenAssist enables and simplifies the process of image selection and generation, making visual authoring more user-friendly and accessible to all.
